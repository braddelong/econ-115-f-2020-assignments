    "AJR are thus confronted with a puzzle. Hence they drop their arguments that:\n",
    "\n",
    ">It is plausible that rich economies are able to afford, or perhaps prefer, better institutions. Arguably more important than this reverse causality problem, there are many omitted determinants of income differences that will naturally be correlated with institutions. Finally, the measures of institutions are constructed ex post, and the analysts may have had a natural bias in seeing better institutions in richer places...\n",
    "\n",
    "And they focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The fact that the institutions variable is measured with considerable error creates attenuation and may bias the OLS estimates downwards.... [Andf in fact this] measurement error in the institutions variables that creates attenuation bias is likely to be more important...\n",
    "\n",
    "But they make no mention of the either very strong positive or negative causal relationship running from prosperity to governance-quality that taking their settler-mortality C variable to be a valid instrument implies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, they turn to arguing that their instrumental-variable results are trustworthy, and as a result there are:\n",
    "\n",
    ">large effects of institutions on income per capita... [that] account for roughly three-quarters of the differences in income per capita...\n",
    "\n",
    "If we considered an alternative counterfactual world in which other, outside factors had reached in and enforced institutions of equal quality in all countries of the globe, and let that equal institutional quality together with the other factors that determine institutions in our world operate, we would find three-quarters of our world's variation in prosperity gone.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are confident in this conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are they confident? Because, they argue, their settler-mortality C variable is a valid instrument:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Settler mortality affected settlements; settlements affected early institutions; and early institutions persisted.... The validity of our... results... depends on the assumption that settler mortality in the past has no direct effect on current economic performance. Although this presumption appears reasonable, here we substantiate it further by directly controlling for many of the variables that could plausibly be correlated with both settler mortality and economic outcomes. Overall, we find that our results change remarkably little with the inclusion of these variables, and many variables emphasized in previous work become insignificant once the effect of institutions is controlled for.... identity of\n",
    "the colonial power... legal origin... the fraction of the populations that are Catholic, Muslim, and of other religions... temperature and humidity... average, minimum and maximum monthly high temperatures, and minimum and maximum monthly low temperatures, and morning minimum and maximum humidity, and afternoon minimum and maximum humidity... the prevalence of malaria... the current population... fraction of Europeans... ethnolinguistic fragmentation... soil quality and natural resources... whether the country is landlocked.... The effect of variations in institutions caused by early colonial experience on income is robust, and likely captures the causal effect of institutions and government policies on economic well-being...\n",
    "\n",
    "They propose an alternative theory—that their instrumental-variables estimate is higher because the best-fit line through the original scatter is reduced in slope by \"attenuation bias\". Once more dropping into math, suppose that, as before, governance-quality leads to prosperity through a causal channel the strength of which is measured by the value of $ \\beta $:\n",

    "\n",
    ">$ H = G = \\eta $.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is true, then our original slope from the original full scatter is thus:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$ \\hat{\\beta}_{OLS} = \\frac{\\sigma_{YH}}{\\sigma_H^2} $\n",

    "In order for this explanation to work, however, settler mortality early in the age of imperialism has to (a) be correlated with that part of modern-day institutions that matter for prosperity, the G, while also (b) being uncorrelated with those parts of modern-day institutions that do not matter for prosperity, the $ \\eta $. The original best-fit scatter line attributes the superior prosperity of the countries in the upper-right of the scatter—the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and company—to their possession of institutions of higher quality by 3.5 points on the PRS scale. But given settler mortality, we would only have anticipated that they would have institutions of 2 points higher quality on the PRS scale—and it is those 2 points that matter, with the extra 1.5 points being spurious features of today's institutions that we regard as good government, but that are not in fact important.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. There is reverse causation from prosperity to governance quality, but it runs in the counterintuitive direction—more prosperity sets in motion social processes that reduce the quality of governance.\n",
    "2. There is reverse causation from prosperity to governance quality, and it is very strong—small positive differences in prosperity for countries with the same $ \\nu $ factors lead to very large positive differences in governance quality.\n",
    "3. Settler mortality early age of imperalism is much more highly correlated with those features of today's institutions that matter for prosperity than with those features of today's institutions that do not matter for prosperity.\n",
    "4. Independent of the causal association between settler morality and institutions in the past, between institutions in the past and institutions today, and between institutions today and prosperity, the factors that made regions unhealthy for European settlers early in the age of imperialism either make or are correlated with factors that make countries poor today.\n",
