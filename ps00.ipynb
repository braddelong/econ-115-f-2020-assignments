    "\n",
    "These computer programming problem set assignments are a required part of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborating on the problem sets is more than okay—it is encouraged! Seek help from a classmate or an instructor or a roommate or a passerby when you get stuck! (Explaining things is beneficial, too—the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it.) \n",
    "\n",
    "But the work has to be your own: no cutting-&-pasting from others' problem sets, please! We want you to learn this stuff, and your fingers typing every keystroke is an important way of building muscle memory here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, we strongly recommend that as you work through this notebook, whenever you come to a \"code\" cell—something intended not for you to read but also to direct the computer—the python interpreter—to do calculations, you (1) click on the code cell to bring it into your browser's focus; (2) click on the `+` button in the toolbar above to create a new code cell just below the one you were now in; and then (3) retype, line-by-line, the computer code in the cell (not the comment lines beginning with `#`s, but the code cells) while trying to figure out what the line of code is intended to tell the python interpreter to do. \"Muscle\"—in this case, fingertip—memory is an important but undervalued part of \"active learning\" here at Berkeley. In Germany, however, they have a term for it: _das Fingerspitzengefühl_; it's the kind of understanding-through-the-fingertips that a true expert has.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem set, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. navigate jupyter notebooks (like this one);\n",
    "2. write and evaluate some basic *expressions* in python, the computer language of the course;\n",
    "3. call *functions* to use code other people have written; and\n",

    "## 0. Why Are We Doing This?\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we are doing this because our section leaders are overworked: teaching online takes more time and effort than teaching in person, and our section leaders were not overpaid before the 'rona arrived on these shores. Taking the bulk of the work of grading calculation assignments off of their backs is a plus—and it appears that the best way for us to do that is to distribute a number of the course assignements to you in this form: the form of a python computer language \"jupyter notebook\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we are doing this because learning jupyter notebooks and python may well turn out to be the intellectual equivalent for you of \"eat your spinach\": something that may seem unpleasant and unappetizing now, but that makes you stronger and more capable. In 1999 Python programming language creator Guido van Rossem compared the ability to read, write, and use software you had built or modified yourself to search and analyze data and information collectiosn to literacy (see Fernando Perez: When Python Becomes Pervasive <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd6a3JIFH0s>). He predicted that mass programming, if it could be attained, would produce increases in societal power and changes in societal organization of roughly the same magnitude as mass literacy has had over the past several centuries. Guido may be right, and he may be wrong. But what is clear is that your lives may be richer, and you may have more options, if the data science and basic programming intellectual tools become a useful part of your intellectual panoplies.\n",
    "\n",
    "An analogy: An anology: Back in the medieval European university, people would learn the trivium—the “trivial” subjects of grammar (how to write), rhetoric (how to speak in public), and logic (how to think coherently)—then they would learn the quadrivium of arithmetic, geometry, music/harmony, and astronomy/astrology; and last they would learn the advanced and professional subjects: law or medicine or theology and phyics, metaphysics, and moral philosophy. But a student would also learn two more things: how to learn by reading—how to take a book and get something useful out of it, without a requiring a direct hands-on face-to-face teacher; and (2) how to write a _fine chancery hand_ so that they could prepare their own documents, for submission to secular courts or to religious bishops or even just put them in a form where they would be easily legible to any educated audience back in those days before screens-and-attachments, before screens-and-printers, before typewriters, before printing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data science tools may well turn out to be in the first half of the 2000s the equivalent of a _fine chancery hand_, just as a facility with the document formats and commands of the Microsoft office suite were the equivalent of a _fine chancery hand_ at the end of the 1900s: practical, general skills that make you of immense value to most if not nearly all organizations. This—along with the ability to absorb useful knowledge without requiring hands-on person-to-person face-to-face training—will greatly boost your social power and your set of opportunities in your life. If we are right about its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, why jupyter and python, rather than r-studio and r, or c++ and matlab? Because jupyter project founder Fernando Perez has an office on the fourth floor of Evans. Because 40% of Berkeley undergraduates currently take Data 8 and so, taking account of other channels, more than half of Berkeley students are already going to graduate literate in python.\n",
